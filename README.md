# TIc-Tac-Toe-Project

for this project i used HTML for  creating the webpage and css for the stylization process
I used JQuery for most of the JavaScript functions. I also used sweetAlert for  styling the pop up alerts in the webpage

one of the best advices giving to us during the course was divding each problem into small steps. this is the  approach i focused on and it was also very helpfull because your baically setting small goals for yourslef and each goal you accomplish keeps the motiviation and the confidince level high for you to continue pushing on. this project helped in sementing that this  approach is probably the best when moving forward and trying to stick to should be key in the upcoming lessons.

one of the unsolved problems and  something i realized later on was that the sequence of the event wasn't quite how i envsioned it and it made the program looks a little bit buggy.
when one player wins the round, the app first restart the turn without placing the last  piece of 'X' or 'O' depending on the winner
also the alert pop ups appear a little bit sooner than i wished for. what i wanted was for the X and O signs to stay on the screen until i press  ok in the alert pop up then do the restart process. 
I tried rearranging the code; however, that didn't solve the issue

The most important part is sovling for the winner. I created three variables each variable targets an index in an array inside the main array then loops through it to see if the variables match a winning combination.
